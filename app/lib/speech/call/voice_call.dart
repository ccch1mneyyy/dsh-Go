// 语音通话: talking with a conversation, hands free. The microphone is cut into
// utterances on the phone (speech/call capture: echo cancellation, a speech
// gate, 300 ms kept before each start); each utterance is recognized whole
// (DeepSeek's recognizer by default) and sent as an ordinary message; the reply
// is read aloud while it is still being written.
//
// Speaking over the reply (插话打断, on by default) goes in two steps, as voice
// agents do it: she steps back at once (quieter), and what was said decides —
// agreement (嗯、对、好的) and noise let her carry on, 停 / 等一下 stop her, and
// anything else, or talking on past [VoiceCallController.confirmAfter] (1.6 s), is the
// person taking the turn: she stops, the turn behind her too, and the next
// message tells the model where she was cut off.
//
// The controller knows nothing of widgets or of where messages go: a
// [CallConversation] sends and reports the reply, a [VoiceCloud] recognizes,
// [voice] makes a fresh [SpeechOut] for each reply.
