/// Tells the platform when the app wants the screen's fastest refresh rate.
///
/// [RefreshRateMode.auto]: while Flutter is producing frames (animations, scrolling,
/// streaming output) the window asks for the fastest mode at its resolution; after
/// [idleAfter] without a frame it drops the preference and the system decides again.
/// [RefreshRateMode.max] keeps it pinned; [RefreshRateMode.system] never declares one.
///
/// Some ROMs (HyperOS, OriginOS, ColorOS) cap third-party apps at 60 Hz unless the app
/// asks, and once it does they show the per-app refresh-rate switch as an in-app setting
/// — so the app has to offer the choice itself, including handing the decision back.
///
/// HarmonyOS has no such switch, but its Flutter engine votes its own rate: 120 under a
/// finger, 60 from 3 s after, and only scrolls and routes vote in between, so springs, sheets
/// and streaming output run at what that leaves. There active asks the engine for 120, which
/// is a real cost rather than a preference, so it follows motion and not any frame: several
/// frames in a row at animation cadence. A blinking cursor, two frames a second, doesn't
/// start it or hold it up. The price is about [motionFrames] frames at the old rate at the
/// start of a motion that no finger began.
