// HarmonyOS suspends an app soon after it leaves the screen, and the on-device
// engine runs as this app: a turn left running gets the system's short grant at
// best, then stops where it is, with nothing to say it did. How long the grant was
// and whether the turn can pick up afterwards take a device to know, so this says
// only that it may have paused: one quiet line in the chat on the way back
// (ui/notify/background_pause_host.dart draws it). With the long-running task held for
// the whole time away, nothing paused, so there's no line. Android's own line, about a phone
// cutting the network, is runtime/background_net.dart.
