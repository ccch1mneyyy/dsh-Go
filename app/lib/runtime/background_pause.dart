// HarmonyOS suspends an app within seconds of it leaving the screen, and the
// on-device engine runs as this app: a turn left running stops where it is, with
// nothing to say it did. Whether it can pick up afterwards takes a device to
// know, so this says only that it paused: one quiet line in the chat on the way
// back (ui/notify/background_pause_host.dart draws it). Android's own line, about a
// phone cutting the network, is runtime/background_net.dart.
