// What stands between a person and the pages that act as their forum account
// (我的投稿, 举报): signing in to the forum, the workshop's own checks, and
// agreeing that the workshop is handed the forum credential.
//
// Signing in stays the forum's (its account sheet). The agreement is asked
// here because both pages need it and neither can send the person to the
// other; what is confirmed is the very object the sheet showed
// (workshopAccessProvider, contract §6).
