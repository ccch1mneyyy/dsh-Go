// 「放下这条记录」: the way out when the phone's record of an unfinished
// submission cannot be used (it is damaged, its package is gone, or clearing
// it keeps failing), so the page is not left offering 重试 forever.
//
// Letting go removes the record on this phone and nothing else. The workshop
// is not asked to cancel anything, and the dialog says so before the person
// agrees: a submission that did arrive stays there, and one sent again may
// then exist twice. The state layer reads the record first and hands out an
// offer; the page asks about that offer and returns the very same object.
