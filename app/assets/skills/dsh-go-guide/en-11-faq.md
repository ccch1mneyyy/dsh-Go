# Troubleshooting

## Messages won't send, or no reply comes

Check the host status at the bottom of the chat list.

- **This phone**: open the engine page and check its status and **Logs**. Not installed, stopped and failed to start are different cases; follow the page. When a start fails, the failure card links to the logs and a diagnostics bundle.
- **Remote host**: the remote hosts page offers a fix for the cause, such as **Reconnect**, **Sign in again** or **Trust again**.
- If no model is set up, **Choose model** offers to enter an API key or add a provider.

Reset and uninstall both delete data on this phone; you rarely need them to fix a problem.

<!-- nav: commonSettings,phoneEngineDiagnostics -->
`Settings › Diagnostics` · [Open](dshgo://open/diagnostics)

To report a problem, export a diagnostics bundle here. It includes the version, device, bounded engine logs and captured errors, not all system logs or a complete crash history. The app attempts to remove keys and tokens; still inspect the bundle before sharing it.

To let the AI look into it, tap **Let the AI read diagnostics**. The app writes a bounded snapshot for the local engine, then ask the AI to "check the diagnostics". The bundled `dsh-go-support` skill walks the symptoms and drafts an issue you can paste.

### Input-method or keyboard problems

After reproducing the problem, use **Capture recent events** under **System input-method diagnostics**, read the native prompt and confirm it yourself. It only reuses an already selected and connected Shizuku, Sui, wireless-debugging or Root channel; it does not request permissions, open a background screen or operate an editor. With no channel available, **Phone-control permissions (optional)** lets you choose whether to configure one.

A one-time bounded read of existing fixed-tag system logs retains up to 64 known show/hide requests or input-connection-closed events emitted by this app process from the last two minutes. Typed text, candidates and raw log lines are not exported. Android 12 and some vendor systems may have no matching records; zero events and failures do not prove that the keyboard is healthy. There is no continuous monitoring. Backgrounding the app, leaving Diagnostics or clearing cancels the request. Switching focus in multi-window mode while Diagnostics remains visible does not revoke the one short read already approved.

Results stay in app memory. Only **Let the AI read diagnostics** or a manual bundle export includes them; automatic snapshots do not. Manual AI reports and automatic environment snapshots each atomically replace their own fixed file; neither overwrites the other. Clear the in-memory evidence whenever you want, or restart the app. Clearing cannot retract files already generated or shared.

## The engine stops in the background, or notifications don't arrive

<!-- nav: commonSettings,phoneEngineKeepAlive -->
`Settings › Background running` · [Open](dshgo://open/background)

Follow the guide to turn off battery optimization, keep the "engine running" notification, and lock the app in Recents. Limits vary by brand, and Android may still stop the engine.

For notifications, also turn on the alerts you want in the app's **Notifications** and allow DSH Go notifications in system settings. Alerts from remote hosts need the app running and the connection online.

## The engine keeps failing to start

**Automatic Safe mode** on the local engine page is on by default: after two failed starts in a row, the engine starts without plugins. You can also tap **Start in Safe mode** on the same page. Your chats are safe in Safe mode; fix the configuration, then tap **Return to normal mode**. Web settings changed in Safe mode aren't kept.

Direct local engine launch is off by default; you turn it on under Developer options. Once it is on, on a phone where a direct start fails (Android 16 blocks it, for one), it switches to compatible launch on its own: that doesn't count as a failed start and doesn't lead to Safe mode. It keeps using compatible launch until an app update brings a new runtime, and **Diagnostics** shows **Direct launch failed**. To try again, stop the local engine, then turn on **Direct local engine launch** under **Developer options** on the Diagnostics page.

After an upgrade from an earlier version, the first direct start tidies your plugin files once; the engine shows **Tidying plugin files** meanwhile. If the phone is short of space or the tidy-up doesn't finish, that start uses compatible launch, **Fallback reason** on the **Diagnostics** page says why, and the next start carries on. No files are lost.

## The app can chat, but headless reports MISSING_CREDENTIAL

`dsh --profile headless` starts a separate one-shot task. Its default profile disables the interactive credential store, authorization and DeepSeek account services, so it does not automatically use API keys or account sign-ins saved in the app. A working chat in the app does not mean this command has credentials configured.

The default DeepSeek official API route needs `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`. Supply it in the process environment that launches the command, or set your own API key as `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...` in the launch directory's `.env` or `$DSH_HOME/.env`. These are read in order: process environment, launch directory's `.env`, then `$DSH_HOME/.env`. An exported empty variable also shadows the `.env` fallback; unset that empty variable before using a file instead. Keep real keys out of chats, issue reports and source control.

DeepSeek account sign-in and an official API key are different credentials. An account sign-in token cannot be used as `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`. You can keep using the account in the app, or configure an API key separately for headless.

Adding the app's sign-in patch alone does not enable the services that headless disables by default. Custom profiles and remote hosts may use different configurations; follow the configuration of that host.

## Phone control doesn't work

The top of the phone control page says what's missing:

- The switch is off, or the engine hasn't started.
- You're connected to a remote host: switch to **This phone**.
- DSH isn't installed on this phone: install it first.
- Safe mode is on: return to normal mode.
- Accessibility is off: tap **Turn on**. For a sideloaded app, allow restricted settings first.

If a task stopped midway: turning the screen off, locking the phone, or DSH making no new move for 3 minutes ends it. See [Phone control](04-phone-control.md).

## The floating bar is in the way

Tap the dot at the bar's left end (or **Shrink to a ball** in its card) to shrink it to a ball you can drag out of the way, or turn on **Collapse when idle** on the phone control page. The capsule and the ball fade when idle; lower **Idle opacity** to fade them more.

## The pet is gone

- Not in chats: if the pet page is set to **None**, choose a pet; if it's hidden for an hour, tap **Show now**.
- Not outside the app: check that **Show outside the app** is on and display over other apps is allowed. **When to show** defaults to **When active**, which hides the pet after 5 quiet minutes. If it was hidden for today, tap **Restore** on the pet page. It also hides while the app is in the foreground and during phone control tasks.

See [Pets](06-pets.md).

## A plugin is installed but doesn't show up

Check that the plugin is enabled, and restart the engine if asked. A plugin's native UI needs the dsh-go bridge on the host: this phone's engine has it built in, remote hosts usually don't. A display place may also be turned off in the plugin's details. Plugin panels without a native UI appear in the Plugins group of All features, opening in the app or as Web entries. See [Plugins](08-plugins.md).

## What the app sends

<!-- nav: commonSettings,hubPrivacy,usageStatsTitle -->
`Settings › Privacy and sharing › Send anonymous usage stats` · [Open](dshgo://open/usage-stats)

dsh-go’s own anonymous usage statistics are on by default; the switch is on the welcome screen the first time you open the app. If you updated from an earlier version, a one-time notice at the bottom of the home screen tells you, and can turn it off right there. While it's on, the app sends anonymous stats for the days before, at most once a day, and only this: app and Android version, CPU architecture, phone maker and model (such as `V2405A`, from 1.0.15), the maker's system and its version (such as OriginOS 5.0, from 1.0.15), app language, how the local engine was started, and that day's number of messages, voice inputs, phone control tasks, generations, shares and installed plugins. Devices are told apart by a random ID that changes every 90 days.

These statistics never include accounts, API keys, chats, files, prompts or host addresses, or device identifiers such as phone number or IMEI. Turning this switch off stops these dsh-go statistics; the random ID and the counts kept on the phone are deleted at once.

## Local text recognition and Google ML Kit

<!-- nav: commonSettings,hubSettingsPhoneControl -->
`Settings › Phone control`

Phone control uses bundled Google ML Kit Chinese text recognition (`com.google.mlkit:text-recognition-chinese:16.0.1`), enabled by default; turn it off separately with **On-device text recognition (ML Kit)** on that page. Recognition runs on this device; screenshots and recognized text are not sent to Google. Google’s SDK collects usage statistics such as device model, app version and processing time. The anonymous usage statistics switch above does not control this SDK.

Screenshots and recognized text may be sent to your configured model as part of phone control. While off, recognition requests do not trigger SDK loading or initialization. Turning local recognition off prevents new recognition; work already started may still finish. It does not uninstall the SDK, clear previously accumulated SDK statistics, or guarantee that old SDK statistics stop being sent. A device that has never initialized the SDK and a device previously used with recognition enabled have different histories.

Remote’s pairing scanner also uses ML Kit and initializes the shared SDK separately when the scanner opens. Camera scanning and reading a gallery image do not require phone control or text recognition to be enabled, and do not change that setting. To connect without using ML Kit for pairing, use the Remote account sign-in path instead.

See [Google ML Kit terms](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms) and [Android SDK data disclosure](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/android-data-disclosure). These SDK terms are distinct from the Apache 2.0 license attached to example code in the documentation.

## The guide doesn't match what I see

Check the app version under **Version** in Settings and compare it with the version in the [guide index](../README.md). The app is always right.
