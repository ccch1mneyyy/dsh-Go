# Pets

Pick a pet to keep you company in chats. When a turn finishes, fails, or waits for your approval or answer, it pops up a bubble. It can also float outside the app.

## Choose a pet

<!-- nav: commonSettings,botsPets -->
`Settings › Pets` · [Open](dshgo://open/pets)

Tap **Pets** in the Appearance group of Settings, or touch and hold the pet in a chat and choose **Pet settings**. Choose a pet first; the other settings appear below it.

- Choose **Deepy**, **Whale girl** or **None**.
- **Size**: **Small**, **Standard** or **Large**. Standard by default.
- **Quiet mode**: animations only, no bubbles.

The pet, size and Quiet mode apply both in and outside the app.

## In chats

- The pet sits above the composer; drag it left or right to move it.
- Tap a bubble to jump to its chat; swipe up to dismiss it.
- Touch and hold the pet for **Change pet**, **Hide for 1 hour** and **Pet settings**. While it's hidden, **Show now** appears on the pet page.

## Show outside the app

1. On the pet page, turn on **Show outside the app** (off by default).
2. Allow "Display over other apps" when asked. If phone control's accessibility service is on, no extra permission is needed. Without permission, the switch turns itself off and shows **Not allowed**.
3. Under **When to show**, choose **When active** (default) or **Always**. When active: shows while a reply is running, a bubble is up, or there was activity in the last 5 minutes.

The floating pet hides while the app is in the foreground and during phone control tasks.

Floating pet: tap to play with it, tap twice to open the chat that needs you most (approvals and questions first); drag it and it snaps to the edge and stays there; drag it onto the × or touch and hold and choose **Hide for today** to hide it for the day. Tap **Restore** on the pet page to bring it back.

The floating window can show the companion from the Companion room instead: with **Show outside the app** on, choose **Room companion** under **Show in the floating window** (**Pixel pet** by default; if you gave her a name, the option shows it). You need a character in the Companion room first; until then the option can't be chosen. She uses more battery than the pixel pet, and stops when the screen is off or the window is hidden. If this phone can't show her, the window goes back to the pixel pet. Once she is chosen, **Framing** below offers **Full body** or **Half body**.

While she is in the floating window, one tap plays with her: her head, face and body each get a different reaction, and her eyes go to where you tapped. Tapping twice opens the chat, and dragging and touch and hold work as they do for the pixel pet.

On Android 13 and later, if the switch still won't turn on after visiting system settings, **Switch disabled** appears on the pet page. Tap it for brand-specific steps to **Allow restricted settings**.

## Action wheel and screenshot questions

Touch and hold the floating pet. A fan of round buttons opens toward the inside of the screen, each with its name on the outer side. Keep your finger down and slide toward an action: it grows and its name is highlighted; release to choose it. Slide back onto the pet or outside the fan before releasing to cancel. If you release without sliding, the fan stays open: tap an action, or tap anywhere else to close it. The fan mirrors at the opposite screen edge; tapping and ordinary dragging are unchanged. Small screens or large fonts use a scrollable list when the fan will not fit; release without sliding, then scroll and tap.

Choose **Screenshot & ask DSH-Go** to hide the pet and wheel, capture the current screen and automatically return to the app with the image as a pending attachment in a new chat. Type your question, then tap Send. Nothing is sent to AI automatically, and the previous conversation's draft is not overwritten. Existing text and attachments in the new-chat draft are kept; attachment limits are reported if the image cannot be added.

Capture requires Android 11 or later and phone control's accessibility service to be enabled. Overlay permission alone is not enough. Pages protected against screenshots are not bypassed. The image uses only the app's private temporary cache, which is removed once read into the draft; it is not saved to the gallery. If a phone blocks opening the app from the background, tap the notification to continue.

## Quick ask, bubble decisions and voice

Long-press the floating pet and choose Quick ask to open its input bar. The target line names the conversation and host; switch to a new conversation if needed. Messages go through normal chat and appear in its history. If the host or connection changes, reopen the bar to confirm the target. Back or a tap outside closes the bar.

Approval bubbles show complete tool arguments when a request can be handled there. Missing or lengthy arguments and requests needing detailed interaction open the app instead. Simple single-choice questions can be answered in the bubble. Expired requests cannot be submitted.

The microphone uses the phone's installed offline speech model and does not fall back to a cloud provider. If the model is unavailable, follow the setup guidance. If Android blocks background recording or returns silence, a separate foreground recording dialog brings recognized text back to the input bar. Sending still requires your action, and an existing chat draft is preserved.

## Companion room

The companion room is a separate full page with an animated Live2D character. It isn't the status pet above: the pet watches the agent for you, and the room is a place to spend a little time.

Open the **Switch host** panel and tap **Companion room**. The first time, import an asset pack (zip). Character assets aren't part of the app and stay on this phone; you can remove them from the menu at the top right of the room.

What you can do:

- Touch her: stroke her head to pat it, and tap her face, body or tail for different reactions. Three quick pokes make her dizzy. None of this calls a model or spends tokens.
- Move the phone: tilt it to one side and she drifts that way with the water, tips over a little, then finds her balance. Shake it hard a few times and she gets dizzy and lets out a stream of bubbles. None of this happens when the phone has reduced motion turned on, and shaking does nothing on phones without a motion sensor.
- Talk to her: type or use voice in the bar at the bottom. Choose how in **How she talks** in the menu at the top right:
  - **Light**: chat only. The phone uses the DeepSeek API key you saved in Settings to talk to the model directly, with no engine and no host. The chat stays on this phone, and **Start over** deletes it. Not available when you signed in with a DeepSeek account and saved no key.
  - **Full**: uses DSH on the current host, in its own conversation that stays out of the chat list. **View chat history** in the menu opens it, and **Start over** begins a new conversation while the old record stays on the host. She can use the host's tools, and the phone too when phone control is on; anything that acts asks you first, and only a tap on the screen counts as yes.
  - Until you choose, she uses Full while a host is connected and Light otherwise.
- Zoom: pinch to zoom and move.
- Her corner: there's a snack in the shell at the bottom left, a bubble floating on the right, and a seaweed cushion behind her. Tap the shell to give her a snack, the bubble to play, and the cushion to let her rest for a while. What she's doing shows under her name.
- Feed her, hold her: drag a snack out of the shell dish and let go at her mouth, and she eats it. Rest a finger on her to give her a hug. Tilt the phone and the reef shifts a little.
- Her voice: turn it on under **Her voice** in the menu and she reads her words aloud; she stops as soon as you type or use the microphone. Use the phone's own voice; pick one of the **Popular services** (Xiaomi MiMo, OpenAI, SiliconFlow, Alibaba Model Studio), add its key and choose a voice (with Xiaomi MiMo you can also clone a voice from a recording); or connect your own speech service: an OpenAI-compatible API (OpenAI, SiliconFlow, or your own GPT-SoVITS or CosyVoice server) or a custom HTTP API you describe. Tap **Preview** to check it works. With an external service, what she says is sent to it.
- About her: under **About her** in the menu, change her name, what she calls you, and her persona: who she is, her personality, how she talks, all of it, with **Reset** to start over. The default persona includes a few boundaries you can delete; only the format of her expression marks is added by the app.
- Getting closer: visit and pat her often and she slowly gets more familiar with you; **You two** in the menu shows how far you've come. Once you're close she hums more and has fonder words for a pat.
- Your other chats: while the room is open, she tells you when another chat finishes, fails or waits for your approval; tap Take a look to go there.
- Home-screen widget: add the Companion room widget to see what she's doing and the last thing she said. Tap it to visit.
- Her invitations: when you sit quietly with her for a while, she may now and then ask, above the input bar, whether you'd like to rest on the cushion together. Tap **Sure** and she leans back on it; tap **Not now** or just leave it, and she waits a while before asking again. She asks silently. Choose how often in **How often she speaks up** in the menu at the top right: **Now and then** by default (at most twice a day, at least 6 hours apart), **Often** or **Chatty** for more, **Quiet** for none. Mentions of your other chats count toward the same allowance.

She notices that you visit and pat her, and slowly gets more familiar with you; staying away for a few days doesn't upset her. Write down things you want her to remember in **What she remembers** in the menu. You can edit or delete them anytime. In Full mode they stay on the current host; in Light mode, on this phone. She doesn't bring these up by herself yet, can't speak aloud and only shows text, and can't touch your files or phone.

If this host's engine is older, she runs on the default preset and may ask to use tools. When "Something needs your confirmation" appears, tap it and handle the request in the regular chat.

## Workshop

The Workshop holds pixel pets and companions other people made. Pick the ones you like and install them on this phone, or send in your own. There are two ways in: the **Workshop** row on the pet settings page, and **Workshop** in the menu at the top right of the companion room. If the row isn't there, this version isn't connected to a workshop yet.

The page has three tabs:

- **Browse**: look around, search, and filter by **Pixel pets** or **Companions**. Tap an item for its description, author, license and size, and tap **Get** to download and install it. A pet is added to the pets you can choose, and a companion becomes the character in the room; you're asked first when something already on this phone would be overwritten. Browsing and installing need no sign-in.
- **Installed**: what came from the Workshop onto this phone. A new version, or an item withdrawn by its author or a reviewer, is marked here; open an item to update or uninstall it. This tab works offline.
- **My uploads**: what you sent in and where each one stands in review. Sign in to your forum account first.

To submit: tap **Submit** under **My uploads**, pick a pet you imported or your current companion, fill in the name, author, license and source link, check the packed result, tick **I confirm I have the right to share this** and send it. A reviewer looks at it first, and it shows up under **Browse** once approved; a rejection says why, and you can fix it and send it again. To take one back, open it and tap **Withdraw**.

The first time you submit, view your uploads or report something, the app asks you to confirm one thing: the Workshop tells who you are by your forum account, by sending your forum sign-in credential to the Workshop service, which asks the forum whose it is. The page shows both addresses, and nothing is sent until you tap **Agree and continue**. You can browse and install without agreeing.

If something is wrong with an item (infringement, unsuitable content), tap **Report** in its details and say why. A reviewer handles the report; an item isn't taken down automatically because it was reported.
