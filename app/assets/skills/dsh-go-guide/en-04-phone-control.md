# Phone control

Let DSH read the screen, tap and type to get things done on your phone. Pause or stop it anytime. Phone control works only with this phone's engine and isn't loaded in Safe mode.

## Turn it on

<!-- nav: commonSettings,hubSettingsPhoneControl -->
`Settings › Phone control` · [Open](dshgo://open/phone)

1. Turn on the switch at the top. The first time, you'll see what's read and where it goes; tap **Agree**. Turning it on or off restarts a running engine, interrupting any reply in progress.
2. Under **Setup**, tap **Turn on** next to **Accessibility service**, and turn on "DSH Phone Control" in Android's accessibility settings. If the switch won't turn on for a sideloaded app, tap **Accessibility switch disabled?** for brand-specific steps to allow restricted settings.
3. Tap **Turn on** next to **Notifications** and allow notifications in App info. Approvals and the stop button need them.
4. Tap **Read current screen** to see what DSH can read. This reading isn't sent to the model.

During a task, text on the screen is sent to the model you chose; with a vision model, a screenshot may be included. Bank card and ID numbers are masked first.

## Restore accessibility automatically

<!-- nav: commonSettings,hubSettingsPhoneControl,a11yRestoreTitle -->
`Settings › Phone control › Restore accessibility automatically`

Expand **More settings** and open this row, read the explanation and tap **Authorize and enable**. A connected Shizuku, Sui, root or self-ADB channel can grant permission (the page says which one it will use). If neither is available, follow the setup page or copy the displayed command and run it once on your computer. Restoration requires both the in-app phone-control switch and the system permission.

When authorizing through Shizuku (including Sui) or self-ADB, the app checks whether the permission was actually granted. It distinguishes an authorization request that could not be completed through the channel, an explicit system denial, and an acknowledged request that still left the permission ungranted. An explicit denial is not reported as an ADB disconnection. A temporary Shizuku or self-ADB authorization connection may close normally afterward; that alone does not mean the attempt failed. If the system denies permission, using the computer command is not guaranteed to succeed.

After granting permission, turning off the accessibility service in Android settings will trigger an attempt to turn it back on. To stop phone control, turn off the switch inside DSH Go. Restoration changes only DSH Go's service entry and preserves other accessibility services.

After a system force-stop, reopen DSH Go before it can recover. Repeated failures back off to about ten minutes between attempts. This permission does not keep the app alive indefinitely or fix the underlying cause of a service crash.

## Android Shell (separate authorization)

<!-- nav: commonSettings,hubSettingsPhoneControl,androidShellTitle -->
`Settings › Phone control › Android Shell`. Off by default: enable Phone control, then separately accept the Shell risk notice. Commands run in Android `sh` on this phone, not Ubuntu bash. Accessibility, the background display, and Android 14 are not required.

- Shizuku: install and start Shizuku yourself, explicitly request authorization here, then connect. The actual service identity may be shell (UID 2000) or root (UID 0); check the status and each command confirmation.
- **Self-ADB**: enable Wireless debugging in Android Developer options, open its pairing-code dialog, and enter the six-digit code and pairing port here (or use discovery). Connect after pairing. The connection port differs from the pairing port; leave it blank to discover a local endpoint. Pairing codes are not saved or logged. This feature does not contact other devices.

Every `android_shell` tool call requires native confirmation of the complete command and actual identity. Screen-control task/always confirmation exemptions do not apply. System authorization, background-display authorization, and accessibility-restoration authorization do not authorize arbitrary commands. App rules cannot constrain every Shell operation. Do not rewrite a refused command or switch channels to bypass a refusal.

The default command deadline is 30 seconds, with a 60-second maximum. Commands are limited to 2048 UTF-8 bytes, with a shared 64 KiB text-output cap and explicit truncation. Results include the actual exit code, stdout, stderr and timeout/cancellation status. Output goes to the current model: do not run commands that print secrets, login state or other content you do not want sent. Interactive terminals, binary transfer and persistent background jobs are not supported. Ubuntu paths, working directories and environment are not inherited.

**Stop Android Shell** cancels commands. Turning off Phone control, ending the task, turning off the screen or stopping the engine also invalidates execution. Cancellation attempts to terminate the owned process group; it cannot undo changes or requests already sent to Android services, nor guarantee cleanup of scripts that deliberately detach from the group. After timeout, disconnection or an unknown result, inspect the outcome rather than automatically retrying or replaying through another backend. This is not a sandbox: shell is not root and cannot arbitrarily read other apps’ private data.

## Ask DSH to do something

Go back to a chat and say what you want done. While a task runs:

- Keep the screen on and unlocked. Turning the screen off stops the task.
- Passwords, verification codes, payments and system settings are up to you (unless you turn them on under Lift limits below). When a step needs you, **Your turn** appears; tap **Continue** when you're done. When one of these rules is the reason, the card's title says so, like **Passwords and codes are yours to enter** or **System settings are yours to change**.
- A task ends on its own when DSH makes no new move for 3 minutes.

Alarms, events, maps and sharing don't need the accessibility service.

## Floating bar

When a task starts, a floating bar appears in the lower middle of the screen, and a faint band of colour lights up round the screen's edge to show the phone is being operated. The bar takes three shapes, and a tap moves between them:

- Capsule: one line saying what DSH is doing, like "Tap “Send”", with **Pause** and **Stop** on the right. After **Pause**, the button reads **Continue**; tap it to let DSH carry on. Hold and drag the capsule to move it: it stays at the height you let go, against the left, the middle or the right, and is there next time. Drag it off the left or right edge to shrink it to a ball on that side.
- Card: tap the line on the capsule to open it. It shows the app DSH is working in, whether approvals are off, the last few steps, and a field to steer DSH another way. Left alone for a few seconds, it goes back to the capsule.
- Ball: tap the dot at the capsule's left end, or **Shrink to a ball** in the card, to shrink it to a ball at the screen edge. Left alone for 3 seconds, the ball fades and slides half out of sight over the edge; a touch brings it back. Tap the ball to open it. Drag it anywhere; it snaps to the nearest edge and stays there next time. **Hold the ball for a second to stop**: a ring closes round it first, and letting go cancels.

When DSH needs your approval, the capsule says "Waiting for you below" and the approval card appears at the bottom of the screen.

Expand **More settings** on the phone control page, then adjust it under **Floating bar** (shown once phone control is on):

- **Idle opacity**: how far the ball fades after 3 seconds untouched, 30% to 100%, 70% by default. A touch brings it back; the capsule, the card and anything waiting for you stay solid.
- **Collapse when idle**: on by default. The capsule shrinks to a ball at the edge after a few idle seconds, and opens by itself when you need to approve something. Turned off, the capsule stays; drag it out of the way.
- **Back to DSH Go when done**: on by default. When the reply ends and the app is in the background, it tries to bring you back to that chat. If the system blocks background windows, use the notification; see Confirmations and return below.

Whatever the settings, the bar closes when the reply ends.

## Stop

- **Stop** on the floating bar, or hold the ball for a second.
- **Stop** on the "Operating your phone" card on the phone control page.
- **Stop phone control** on the engine notification. **Stop engine** on the same notification stops the whole engine.

Stopping phone control also stops every reply in progress on this phone's engine.

## Confirmation

<!-- nav: commonSettings,hubSettingsPhoneControl,phoneConfirmTitle -->
`Settings › Phone control › Confirmation`

- **Always ask** (default): asks before entering a new app, sending, deleting or paying.
- **This task**: asks once per task. Choose **Allow for task** on the approval card, and the rest of the task goes ahead.
- **Always skip**: acts without asking. Asks you to confirm before turning on.

When you pick Phone control during first-time setup, you choose once after agreeing to the disclosure: **Ask me at key steps** (Always ask) or **Fully automatic** (Always skip). You can change it here anytime.

An approval card left for 30 seconds counts as **Decline**. In every mode, system settings and permission pages, passwords and verification codes, and DSH Go itself stay with you unless turned on under **Lift limits**; apps set to Hands off are changed in **App rules**. Confirmation lists these, with links to both.

## Confirmations and return

<!-- nav: commonSettings,hubSettingsPhoneControl,phoneBackgroundGuideTitle -->
`Settings › Phone control › Confirmations and return`

Once phone control is on, this row is under **More settings** on the phone control page; tap it to read the guidance again. **Open system settings** opens DSH Go's system App info page.

When a step needs your decision, DSH Go shows a card. If the card is unavailable, it tries a notification or returns to the app. Allow phone-control notifications and pop-up alerts in system settings. Some phones also offer a permission to display pop-up windows while running in the background; allowing it can help the app return. Menu names vary by system version.

If the app doesn't return after a task finishes, tap **Task complete · View result** in the notification. If the system blocks notifications or background windows, open DSH Go yourself to see the result. Turning on **Back to DSH Go when done** doesn't guarantee that the system will allow it.

## App rules

<!-- nav: commonSettings,hubSettingsPhoneControl,phoneAppRulesTitle -->
`Settings › Phone control › App rules`

Set each app to **Hands off**, **Every step** or **As usual**. Payment, banking and brokerage apps are **Hands off** by default, and WeChat is **Every step**. Unlisted apps work as usual, and sensitive actions still need approval. Loosening a rule explains the risk first; tap **Change anyway** to apply it. Tap **Add app** to add one by package name.

## Lift limits

<!-- nav: commonSettings,hubSettingsPhoneControl,phoneUnlockTitle -->
`Settings › Phone control › Lift limits` · [Open](dshgo://open/phone-unlocks)

All three are off by default, and each turns on separately:

- **System settings**: permissions, installers, security center, notifications.
- **Passwords and codes**: fill in passwords, verification and payment codes. The action log shows •••• and never what was typed.
- **DSH Go itself**: tap and type inside DSH Go.

Turning one on opens a page first: what AI can then do, what could go wrong, and the disclaimer below. Press and hold **I understand the risks, turn on** for about 1.5 seconds to apply it. Turning one off takes a single tap. Nothing can be turned on while a task is running. While any is on, the Phone control page shows **Limits lifted**, the floating bar puts a small lock before its line, and **Limits lifted** in its card brings you back here. Banking and payment apps aren't here; change them in **App rules**.

Disclaimer:

- Once on, AI can do the above without anyone confirming.
- AI can be misled by content in web pages, messages or files.
- Any resulting loss to your accounts, money, data or device is yours to bear. DSH Go and its developers accept no liability.
- Turn it on only when you need it, and off when you're done.
- We advise against turning it on for a device that holds payment or banking details.

## Action log and more settings

Expand **More settings**. **Recent actions** logs every step, without screen contents. Tap **All actions** to see them. The log lasts until the app closes.

**Non-disruptive mode** is directly available on the main page. **More settings** holds the floating bar, accessibility restoration, background running, Check phone control, text recognition, phone skills, Android Shell and recent actions.

**Check phone control** opens a separate page showing only status and start or cancel/cleanup controls. B, C1 and C2 profiles, coverage, individual results, refresh and report export are under **Technical details**. This is a partial check: untested items never count as passed. Opening the page does not start a check.

**Text recognition** shows a switch and a short data notice. Recognition is on-device, results may go to your configured model, and the SDK collects usage statistics. **Privacy details** contains the full Google SDK disclosure, what turning it off does, and the separate shared-SDK use by Remote pairing. Turning it off does not uninstall the SDK or promise to erase or stop sending accumulated statistics.

**Non-disruptive mode**:

Requires Android 14 or later. Only Shizuku and Direct ADB appear initially; Root / Sui are under **More connections (Root / Sui)**. Open one connection to see only the next setup step. Opening the page or expanding an option never authorizes or switches a connection. Direct ADB instructions and manual pairing are under **Pairing help / manual entry**; after pairing, **Cannot connect?** offers manual connection-port entry. Once enabled, only the current connection is shown; expand **Change connection** to switch. Root still requires the risk notice and root-manager authorization; su never runs before that. Connection errors remain visible when options are collapsed.

Keep the screen on and unlocked; Shizuku and Direct ADB also need Wi-Fi and wireless debugging. This page’s **More settings** holds connection keeping, background capacity, screen orientation and requirements. “Keep … channel” is off by default: without it, re-enable the mode after restarting the app or phone. Only turning it on allows DSH Go to try restoring this connection after disconnection, reopening the app or restarting the phone. Root requests authorization again; Shizuku / Sui use existing permission and wait for their service; Direct ADB uses existing pairing. After a system force-stop, open DSH Go yourself. Folding options changes none of these permissions or keeping settings.
- **Background running**: prevents Android from turning off accessibility; opens the phone settings guide.
- **Confirmations and return**: see confirmations and task results in time; see Confirmations and return above.
