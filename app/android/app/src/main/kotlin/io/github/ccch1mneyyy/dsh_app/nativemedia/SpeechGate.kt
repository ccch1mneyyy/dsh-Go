/**
 * Speech activity from the microphone's level, 20 ms frame by frame: an energy gate over an
 * adaptive noise floor, with hysteresis and a hangover.
 *
 * While the app plays a clip the gate is stricter — a higher margin over the floor learned before
 * the clip, a longer run of loud frames, and the first [SETTLE_MS] ignored while the echo canceller
 * adapts — so the clip's own echo is not taken for the person speaking. That only lowers the risk:
 * on a loud speaker without a working echo canceller the clip can still trip it (and stop itself),
 * and quiet speech over the clip can be missed. Nothing here keeps or sends audio.
