/**
 * The out-of-app pet window's frames (docs/design/pets.md §6.1), in physical pixels around one
 * origin, the rest frame's top-left, so switching between them moves nothing on screen:
 *
 * - **rest**: [restBox] × k, the pack's wide hit box with the idle picture's cell
 *   ([PetPack.windowBox]). Kept small: on Android 12+ an app overlay takes every touch over its whole
 *   frame, transparent pixels included, so a bigger window is a bigger dead spot over other apps;
 * - **held**: rest plus the drag reaction's whole cell. Picked up, the pet is drawn lifted (Deepy's
 *   react-drag body reaches 13.6 art px above the wide box), so while held, and until that
 *   picture is gone, the window grows to hold it;
 * - **grown**: rest plus the cell of any animation the pet can play that reaches past it, while
 *   that animation shows: a jump (Deepy's happy, 13 art px up), a laptop (its typing, 8 left), a
 *   thought cloud (its thinking, 12 up and 8 left), notes and props (music, conducting), Zzz. A cell
 *   is trimmed to what its frames draw, so a union only grows where the art does (Deepy's typing:
 *   8 art px left, and above only the 1 its top row needs) and the window takes no more than the
 *   picture.
 *
 * [reach] is every frame the window can take while docked; the dock keeps all of it on screen and
 * clear of the bars, so a grown frame never has to move the pet. [hit] is where a touch is the
 * pet's: the body, not the air a grown frame adds.
 *
 * Cells are placed as [PetView] draws them: the box offset rounded to whole physical pixels, the
 * size rounded on its own. Pure, for the JVM tests.
