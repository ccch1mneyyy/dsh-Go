/**
 * 桌面图标: which `<activity-alias>` (AndroidManifest.xml) is the launcher entry, and how to move
 * between them. Pure, unit-tested on the JVM; [LauncherIconPlugin] reads and writes the states.
 *
 * Every alias points at MainActivity and carries only MAIN / LAUNCHER (plus the static shortcuts);
 * one is enabled after any deferred switch-off. Two rules keep the app on screen while it switches:
 *
 * - A component the system sees as explicitly DISABLED takes every task opened through it down
 *   with it (ActivityManagerService.cleanupDisabledPackageComponentsLocked → RecentTasks); one put
 *   back to DEFAULT does not. So every alias but [ORIGINAL] is `enabled="false"` in the manifest,
 *   and switching off one of those means DEFAULT, never DISABLED.
 * - [ORIGINAL] (enabled in the manifest: fresh installs need an entry) can only be switched off
 *   with DISABLED. That waits while its task is visible or has another app on top ([Plan.deferred]);
 *   going Home settles it immediately. It happens once: going back to 雾蓝 later uses its twin,
 *   [MIST_ALT]. No activity is recreated to switch an icon.
 *
 * New entry first, old ones after, so the app never has none.
